#+TITLE: pac

* What is pac?

**** pac - simple pacman wrapper written in C
This program came to be due to my frustration with pacman - the options are so damn unintuitive.
dnf and apt do this better in my opinion, because their options are straightforward :

```install, search, purge...```

Why not have that kind of verbosity and power of pacman?

* Installation

** Source

#+begin_src
sudo make install
#+end_src

* Running

#+begin_src
pac install <packages>
    remove <pkgs>
    purge <pkgs>
    update
    search <package>
    query <package>
    amputate
#+end_src

So, these are options presented in pacman syntax :

#+begin_src
install  > -S
search   > -Ss
query    > -Q
remove   > -R
purge    > -Rns
amputate > -Rdd
#+end_src
